# Recommended Gear

This boss does **a LOT** of damage. Full enchanted diamond armor might still struggle, but that's the minimum recommended.

## Phase 1 (600–301 HP)

### Ranged Weapons
- **Tridents**: Effective for ranged damage
- **Bows**: Standard reliable option
- **Crossbows**: Good burst damage

All three are mutually decent choices.

### Defense
- **Shield**: Essential for blocking homing skulls
- **Alternative**: Hide behind blocks if no shield available
- The Wither's melee explosion response makes close combat risky

### Strategy
- Maintain distance
- Focus on ranged attacks
- Prepare for homing skulls at 450 HP

## Phase 2 (300–251 HP)

### Melee Weapons
- **Swords with Smite**: Does nearly double the damage compared to Sharpness
- Smite is highly recommended over other enchantments
- Melee is now viable (no explosion knockback)

### Potions
- **Strength Potions**: Always a bonus, highly recommended
- **Healing Potions**: Essential for survival
- **Golden Apples**: Keep several in hotbar

### Defense
- **Note**: Wither is immune to projectile damage in this phase
- Must switch to melee combat
- Increased defense on the Wither means longer fights

### Strategy
- Close-range combat required
- Watch for charge attack warnings (glow + sound)
- Dodge charges, they leave Wither effect clouds

## Phase 3 (≤100 HP)

### Primary Weapon
- **Mace**: Now is your time to shine
- Mace deals massive damage when combined with fall damage
- The Wither's dash attack knocks you into the air
- Use the knockback to your advantage for high-damage Mace hits

### Testing Notes
From single-player testing: Any hit from the knockback of the Wither does a ton of damage with a Mace.

### Potions & Healing
- **Strength Potions**: Critical for finishing the fight
- **Healing Potions**: Have multiple ready
- **Golden Apples**: Use liberally
- **Regeneration**: Helpful for sustained damage

### Defense
- Stay mobile
- Dodge the triple dash charge
- Be ready for frequent dash attacks that launch you upward

### Strategy
- Exploit dash attacks for Mace damage
- Watch for radial skull blasts during skeleton spawns
- Everything is faster and more aggressive
- Position carefully to avoid being overwhelmed

## General Recommendations

### Armor
- **Minimum**: Full enchanted Diamond armor
- **Recommended Enchantments**:
  - Protection IV (or specialized protection)
  - Unbreaking III
  - Mending (if available)
- **Note**: Even with full enchanted Diamond, you may struggle

### Consumables
Stock up before the fight:
- Healing Potions (Instant Health II)
- Strength Potions II
- Golden Apples (both regular and enchanted)
- Food with high saturation

### Backup Equipment
- Extra weapons in case of durability issues
- Backup armor set
- Extra shields

### Environmental Prep
- Clear fighting area of valuable blocks
- The Wither will destroy terrain
- Avoid fighting near important structures
- Consider underground arena to contain destruction

## Bedrock Edition Notes

### Health Pool
- **600 HP** (300 hearts)

### Charged Dash Attack
- Periodically charges at nearest player at high speed
- Deals explosive damage, knocks players back
- Destroys blocks in path

### Half HP Transition
- Wither moves downward and explodes
- Enters 2nd and final phase (different from Java's 3-phase system)

**Note**: The mechanics described in other pages primarily apply to Java Edition. Bedrock Edition has some differences in behavior.
