# Attack Types

The Wither uses a variety of attacks that become more dangerous as the fight progresses.

## Standard Attacks

### Wither Skulls
- **Normal Skulls**: Standard projectiles fired regularly
- **Explosive Skulls**: Occasionally cause larger explosions
- **Dangerous (Blue) Skulls**: 
  - Bigger explosion radius
  - Deal significantly more damage
  - Leave smoke clouds behind

### Direct Fire Attack
- Triggers 20 seconds after the Wither is spawned
- High-speed direct skull shot at a random player
- Marked as a dangerous skull (slow fire shot)
- Regular burst attacks directly at the nearest player throughout the fight

## Homing Skulls

**Activation**: When Wither reaches 450 HP

### Behaviour
- Infinitely chase targeted players
- Track movement and adjust trajectory
- Continue pursuit until blocked or impact

### Counters
- Block with shields
- Hide behind terrain/blocks
- The skulls cannot pass through solid blocks

**Phase 3 Enhancement**: Homing skulls become significantly faster

## Charge Attack

**Activation**: When Wither reaches 250 HP (Phase 2)

### Attack Sequence
1. **Warning Phase**: Wither glows and plays a warning sound
2. **Delay**: 1.5 second wind-up
3. **Charge**: Rapidly charges toward nearest player
4. **Impact**: Explosion damage on contact or collision

### Effects
- Destroys blocks in path
- Leaves Wither effect clouds that linger briefly
- Deals explosion damage to nearby players

### Phase 3 Upgrade: Triple Dash
- Performs three successive charges instead of one
- Half-second delay between each dash
- Each dash is progressively faster
- Same destruction and damage effects per dash

## Dash Attack

**Activation**: Phase 3 only (100 HP and below)

### Behaviour
- Quick burst dash toward nearest player
- Occurs frequently during enraged phase
- **No direct damage** from the dash itself

### Strategic Use
- Knocks players high into the air
- Creates opportunity for Mace counter-attacks
- Falling damage can be combined with Mace for massive damage output

## Radial Skull Blast

**Activation**: Phase 3, during skeleton spawning

### Behaviour
- Triggers whenever a Wither Skeleton is summoned
- Releases 24 Wither skulls in a downward radial pattern
- Skulls spread in all directions
- Each skull explodes after 1 second

### Danger Level
- Creates area denial
- Difficult to avoid in close range
- Combines with other attacks for overwhelming pressure

## Enraged Skull Rework

**Phase 3 Mechanic**

### New Behaviour
- Skulls shoot upward initially
- Pause mid-air for 1.5 seconds
- Then shoot toward the nearest player (per skull)
- Each skull tracks independently

### Visual Indicators
- Red glow on attacks
- Black mist and blue flame/skull particles surround the Wither

## Melee Response

**Phase 1 Only**

- When hit by a melee attack, the Wither explodes
- Launches itself upward
- Creates distance from melee attackers
- **Removed in Phase 2** – melee becomes viable

## Block Destruction

### Passive Ability (All Phases)
- Continuously breaks nearby blocks
- Avoids destroying bedrock (with some edge case fixes)
- Can destroy obsidian
- Maintains clear fighting area
- Prevents easy cover/hiding spots

## Mob Summoning

### Wither Skeleton Spawning
- **Phase 1-2**: Spawns one Wither Skeleton (50 HP) every 10 seconds if none within 10 blocks
- **Phase 3**: Spawning frequency doubles
- Converted skeletons now carry bows (if they had bows before conversion)

### Swarm Spawn (150 HP)
- Triggers at 150 HP threshold
- Spawns multiple smaller Wither Skeletons
- Designed to counter close-range attackers

### Blaze Launch (Phase 2 Transition)
- Spins upward during transition to Phase 2
- Launches Wither Skeletons mounted on Blazes
- Number varies by player count:
  - Fewer than 5 players: 10 Blazes
  - Fewer than 10 players: 20 Blazes
  - More than 10 players: 30 Blazes

## Environmental Effects

### Wither Effect Application
- Applied to most nearby entities
- **Excludes**: Villagers and tamed pets (prevents accidental deaths)

### Mob Corruption
Continuously converts nearby mobs:
- Skeletons → Wither Skeletons
- Zombies → Piglins

### Wither Effect Clouds
- Left behind by charge attacks
- Linger briefly in the environment
- Apply Wither effect to players passing through
