# Wither Phases

The Wither in Wither's Wrath has three distinct phases, each with unique mechanics and increasing difficulty.

## Phase 1: Spawn (600–301 HP)

### General Behaviour
- Fires normal Wither skulls that occasionally cause larger explosions
- Passively breaks nearby blocks and moves away from bedrock
- Can destroy obsidian
- Applies the Wither effect to most nearby entities (excludes villagers and pets to prevent accidental deaths)

### Mob Conversions
The Wither corrupts nearby mobs:
- Skeletons → Wither Skeletons
- Zombies → Piglins

### Melee Hits
- Explodes and moves upward whenever hit by a melee attack

### Mob Summoning
- Spawns a Wither Skeleton (50 HP) every 10 seconds if none are within 10 blocks

### Homing Skulls (450 HP Trigger)
- Begins firing homing Wither skulls that infinitely chase players
- Homing skulls can be blocked by shields or terrain

## Phase 2: Transition (300–251 HP)

### Transition Event
- Spins upward, launching 10 Wither Skeletons mounted on Blazes into the air
- Slams down on the ground, creating a large explosion and launching nearby players upward
- The Wither only triggers the slam when it is on the ground (not time-based)

### Defensive Changes
- No longer explodes when struck by melee attacks
- Becomes immune to projectile damage
- Gains increased defence

### Charge Attack (250 HP Trigger)
- Charge warning: Glows and plays a sound
- 1.5 seconds later, charges towards the nearest player
- Destroys blocks in its path
- Deals explosion damage
- Leaves behind Wither effect clouds that linger briefly

## Phase 3: Enraged (≤100 HP)

**"The Wither becomes enraged!"**

### Enraged Visuals
- Surrounded by black mist with blue flame/skull particles
- Red glow on attacks

### Attack Enhancements
All previous attacks are buffed:
- Homing skulls become significantly faster
- Skeleton summoning occurs twice as often
- Each Wither Skeleton spawn causes the Wither to release 24 Wither skulls in a downward radial blast that explode after 1 second

### Upgraded Charge
Charge attack becomes a triple dash:
- First dash occurs as usual
- Half-second delay between each dash
- Each dash is faster than the last

### Dash Attack
- Frequently performs a quick burst dash toward the nearest player
- This dash attack knocks players into the air but does no direct damage
- Creates opportunities for high mace damage when combined with the knockback

## Additional Mechanics

### Regular Attacks
- 20 seconds after spawning, the Wither shoots a high-speed direct skull at a random player
- Regularly shoots bursts of skulls directly at the nearest player
- Dangerous (blue) skulls have bigger explosions and leave smoke behind

### Swarm Attack (150 HP Trigger)
- A swarm of smaller Wither Skeletons spawns to help deal with close-range attackers

### Blaze Spawning
Varies based on player count:
- Fewer than 5 players: 10 Blazes
- Fewer than 10 players: 20 Blazes  
- More than 10 players: 30 Blazes
